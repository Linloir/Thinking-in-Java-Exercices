Comments:
    1. In line19,20, in order to avoid the loss of precision, two new variable are created to store the original 'int'
       type figures as 'float' type.
       Is there a better way to do division of two 'int' without losing precision?
Question:
    1. How can I get a random number that is always positive ?
